<< Define a table (Loop)
>> FORGE LOOP MyLoop

<< Define columns (Segments)
>> SEGMENT LOOP MyLoop INTO S1
>> SEGMENT LOOP MyLoop INTO S2
>> SEGMENT LOOP MyLoop INTO S3

<< Insert values into columns (Segments)
>> CRAFT "OM" INTO S1 IN MyLoop
>> CRAFT "Val1" INTO S2 IN MyLoop
>> CRAFT "Val2" INTO S3 IN MyLoop

>> CRAFT "Val3" INTO S1 IN MyLoop
>> CRAFT "Val4" INTO S2 IN MyLoop
>> CRAFT "Val5" INTO S3 IN MyLoop

>> CRAFT "Val3" INTO S1 IN MyLoop
>> CHANGE MASTER SEGMENT OF MyLoop TO S1
